Overview

This repository contains an analysis of 20th-century air crashes using Excel Pivot Tables. 
The dataset includes information about air crashes that occurred between 1900 and 1999. 
The analysis aims to provide insights into the yearly trend of crashes and fatalities, 
identify planes with the most crashes, explore top crash locations, and determine airlines responsible for most crashes.
Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about air crashes, including crash dates, location, fatalities, aircraft details, and airline responsible.
